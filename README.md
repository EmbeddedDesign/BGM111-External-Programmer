# BGM111 External Programmer 

An external programming adapter for Silicon Labs BGM111 devices.

## What you need to know

Pinouts for the external programming headers on the BGM111 WSTK can be found in UG122.

### Process

The minimum pins required to program a BGM111 module are:
| Signal | BGM111 Pin | WSTK Pin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reset |  | Debug 10 |
| +3.3V |  | Debug 1 & Simplicity 1 |
| GND |  | Debug 3,5,15,17,19 & Simplicity 7,9,11,13,15 |
| SWCLK |  | Debug 4 |
| SWDIO |  | Debug 2 |

(_NOTE:_ It is important to note that Vdevice on the Debug connector is a refernce voltage for the prorammer and is insufficient to power a target BGM111. Power must be taken from the VMCU pin of the Simplicity connector.)

### Tag Connect

This adapter is designed to work with [Tag-Connect](http://www.tag-connect.com/).
Specifically, [TC2030-MCP-NL](http://www.tag-connect.com/TC2030-MCP-NL) (because of its small footprint) or [TC2030-MCP](http://www.tag-connect.com/TC2030-MCP).

A retaining clip for the TC2030-MCP-NL can be [found here](http://www.tag-connect.com/TC2030-CLIP).

### Ordering Boards

You can order these boards from OSH Park:

Or use the included Gerber files to have them manufactured elsewhere.

### Schematic

(_NOTE:_ The pinouts on the Debug and Simplicity connectors appear to be flipped horizontally in the schematic as they are mounted on the *bottom* of the adatper board.)
